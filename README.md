# pads-haskell
The pads haskell repository contains the code for the Haskell binding for PADS.  For more information about the project, see the
pads website (www.padsproj.org).

# Building

`pads-haskell` currently requires GHC 8.2.2.

## Setup

To generate an appropriate [Stack][1] configuration file and install an
appropriate GHC tool chain:

```bash
$ stack solver    # Updates stack.yaml if necessary
$ stack setup     # Installs ghc in a sandbox for you
```

## Build

To build `pads-haskell`:

```bash
$ stack build
```

# Testing

To run the automated testing infrastructure:

```bash
$ stack test pads-haskell:examples
```

Or to run individual tests:

```bash
$ stack repl
λ> :l Examples.First
...
λ> test
Cases: 89  Tried: 89  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
Counts {cases = 89, tried = 89, errors = 0, failures = 0}
(0.11 secs, 0 bytes)
```

# Contributing and Development

In order to build and view the haddock documentation do the following:

```bash
